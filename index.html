                        <h4>TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques <span>to reduce the file size</span> of your PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!</h4>

                        <h3>Why should I use TinyPNG?</h3>
                        <h4>PNG is useful because it’s the only widely supported format that can store partially <span>transparent images.</span> The format uses compression, but the files can still be large. Use TinyPNG to shrink images for your apps and sites. It will use less bandwidth and <span>load faster.</span></h4>

                    <h4><span>Panda says: </span>Excellent question! When you upload a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, similar colors in your image are combined. This technique is called “quantization”. By reducing the number of colors, 24-bit PNG files can be converted to much smaller 8-bit indexed color images. All unnecessary metadata is stripped too. The result better PNG files with <span>100% support for transparency.</span> Have your cake and eat it too!</h4>

                    <h4>In the above image the file size is reduced by<span> more than 70%.</span> I have excellent eyesight but can’t spot the difference either! Use the optimized image to save bandwidth and loading time and your website visitors will thank you.</h4>

                <div class="difference-content">
                    <h2>Is it supported everywhere?</h2>

                    <h4><span>Panda says: </span>Excellent question! The files produced by TinyPNG are displayed perfectly on all modern browsers<span>including mobile devices.</span> Still need to support Internet Explorer 6? It normally ignores PNG transparency and displays a solid background color. With TinyPNG the background becomes transparent again. Binary transparency without any workarounds!</h4>

If you have an Edge browser you can <a>vote up</a> APNG support on the Microsoft Developer Feedback site.</h4>

                    <h4>You can use Save for Web to export your images as 24-bit transparent PNG files and upload them to TinyPNG. We’ll convert them to tiny indexed PNG files. You can also install the <a>TinyPNG Photoshop plugin</a>. It allows you to scale, preview and save compressed PNG and JPEG images straight from Photoshop.</h4>

                    <h4><span>Panda says: </span>Excellent question! We frequently use PNG images, but were frustrated with the load times. We created TinyPNG in our quest to make our own websites faster and more fun to use with the best compression. In 2014 we added intelligent compression for JPEG images and in 2016 we added support for animated PNG. Compressing images with the website is free for everyone and we like to keep it that way!
